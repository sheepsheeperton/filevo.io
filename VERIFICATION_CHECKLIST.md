## Setup Verification

- [ ] **Database Migration Applied**
  - Run `supabase/migrations/20250113000000_initial_schema.sql` in SQL Editor

- [ ] Response shows: `{ ok: true, count: X }`
- [ ] Check email (configured recipient)
- [ ] Email contains:
  - Property name
  - Document tag
  - Upload link
  - Due date

## Security Verification ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] **Service Role Key** is NEVER imported in client components
- [ ] Only used in:
  - `/lib/supabase/server.ts`
  - Server Components
  - API Routes (`/app/api/*`)

- [ ] Public upload pages (`/r/[token]`) validate tokens server-side
- [ ] Storage bucket is **private** (not public)
- [ ] All downloads use signed URLs (time-limited)
- [ ] RLS is enabled on all tables

## Edge Cases üîç

- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md documents system design
- [ ] ROADMAP.md shows implementation phases
- [ ] `.env.example` lists all required variables
- [ ] Supabase migration file is complete
- [ ] Code comments explain complex logic

## Production Readiness üöÄ

- [ ] Resend domain verified for production emails
- [ ] Database has appropriate indexes
- [ ] No hardcoded test data in code
- [ ] Error handling in place for all user actions
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations

## Final Check

- [ ] Complete a full workflow end-to-end without errors
- [ ] No build errors or warnings
- [ ] No runtime errors in console
- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Data persists between page refreshes
- [ ] Logout and sign back in works

---

## If Any Items Fail

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Vercel/server logs for backend errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure Supabase migration was applied
5. Confirm storage bucket is created and private
6. Review ARCHITECTURE.md for system design
7. Check that all dependencies are installed

## Success Criteria ‚ú®

All checkboxes above should be checked for a production-ready MVP.

If all tests pass: **Congratulations! Your Filevo MVP is ready to use!** üéâ
